Research different functions of MarkDown file format

- Use different levels of Back-ticks to hightlight and format differently
- Right-click file name at top and click "open preview" to view the format changes that take place. Click "split right" to split the screen and get a side-by-side view.

# Quick Points

- HTML, CSS, and JS are the only languages that run natively in the web browser. Everything else is run online through framework.
- Django is a web framework for Python
- Emojis are strings

### Syntax

- The rules that apply to a specific language.
- Specific rules that change between each language.

### Fundamentals of Programming

- Loops
- Variables
- Functions/Methods
- Classes
- Built in functions/commands from that language's standard library

\*These fundamentals are found in every language; it's just a matter of how you use them.

### Functions

1. Always has a name
2. Sometimes has arguments passed to it
3. Has a block of code (body) that runs when it's called.

- Python Function Synax:

```
def functionName():
   print("Hi")


functionName()
```

### Variables

- Think about storing information in a "box." You can open the box when using it in coding.

Types:

- String ("Anything in quotation marks")
- Boolean (True or False)
- Integer (Whole numbers)
- Float (Decimal numbers)

### Lists

- 'List' in Python; 'Array' in JS
- Useful because it holds an entire group of data
- Notated with square brackets
- Access a list by using the "index" - an item's position in the list. Indeces start at 0.
- [-1] starts the index from the end.

### Dictionary

- 'Dictionary' in Python; 'Object' in JS
- Always has a key and a value
- A value can be a string, boolean, integer, float, or variable.
- To access the value, reference the key.

### Loops

- Used to go through a specific amount of times and execute code every time it goes through it. It "iterates" over something (lists, dictionaries, etc).
- They can call something several times.
- Two types: 'for' and 'while'

#### While Loops:

- Does something while a condition is true or false

```
while condition:
    Do this code block
```

- If the code block is true, the code block runs. If it's false, the code block does not run.
- Must add a way to break out of the code (counter variable, break statement, etc)
