    <h1>You can write your thoughts here</h1>
    <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
    <h3>Like that Jeremy guy for example</h3>
    <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
    <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero. Weird...</h5>

        Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this

          this example appropriately.

      Here's what I like about lists:
      <ul>
        They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
      </ul>
      <ul>
        That's about it.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in three is
        cool.
      </ul>

      When you make a list, do it in this order:
      <ol>
        Decide if it's an ordered list or not.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag.
      </ol>
      <li>Use li tags nested int the list for your list items.</li>
      <li>Curevball! You can nest lists inside of each other.</li>
      <ol>
        You've got this, I believe in you!
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>Lines. So many Lines.</h1>
      <hr height="5px" />
      <hr height="5px" />
      <hr height="5px" />
      <hr height="5px" />

      Here's a couple ways you can express yourself.
      <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here.</li>
      <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag.</i></li>
      <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag.</b></li>
      You did it! You should be proud of yourself!

      <i><b>yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF!</b></i>
