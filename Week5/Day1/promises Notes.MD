# Promises

- A promise is an 'asynchronous' action you take and wait on an expected result.
- The result is either what you wanted or not (resolve or reject)
- 'Asynchronous' means that it happens at somepoint in the program, not right when you call it.
- Promises are used to handle asynchronous stuff.
- Websites have things queried from a database, and that takes time to manipulate and work with. We use promises to return things when the promises are pending so it doesn't crash the website.
- You can view website traffic via a tracker on the website.

## Fetch

- When you give a command and are given data in return.
- Fetching data from a website is the primary way we get data that is not local to put on our website.
- Use the fetch function that is on the Fetch API website.
- Fetch always receives two things: a URL (it's good practice to save the URL into a variable.)
