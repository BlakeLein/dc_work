## How "Discover America" Works

---

### Wesbite Overview

"Discover America" is a website that utilizes the NPS and Open Weather APIs to provide users with up-to-date information regarding their favorite National Parks and presents it to them in a clean, consistent format. At the click of a button, you can find and view all practical information related to visiting a national park. If it's a park you are particularly interested, you can add the park to your list of favorites, where they will be waiting for you in a separate tab ready to be reviewed.

## "Discover America" In Development

This website represents the second major project in our Digital Crafts coursework and demonstates an ability to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM manipulation, and API implementation.

As with our first project, there are several things that come to mind to expand and improve "Discover America" down the road:

- Creating a "plan-your'trip" feature that allows users to view more information related to actually visiting a national park (road maps, available flights, other attractions, relevent news, etc).
- Including a multi-day weather forecast for each park, not just a current weather forecast.
- A more sophisticated memory storage technique for users to keep track of their favorite parks (this would include a back-end server access).
